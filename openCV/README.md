### World of Warcraft: A Fisherman's friend - the openCV noobfriendly version

Setup:
--------------
* 1. Download python 3 on your computer (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* 2. google "how to install pip for python windows", then do so.
* 3. open your cmd ( Windows key + R and type cmd)
* 4. position yourself in the folder where you have this downloaded, if you put the fishermansfriend folder on your desktop then run this in your cmd: "cd Desktop/fishermansfriend/openCV"
* 5. run this command to install the required packages: "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
* 6. run the bot with "python3 fisherman2.py" (alternatively the command is "python fisherman2.py")


for all other questions refer to the non openCV readme file or send me an email/message :)

There is a picture of the bobber in wailing caverns which the bot uses for detection, if you feel like it could be working better you can take your screenshot and replace the "wcbobber.png" with it
